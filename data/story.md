# The Wormhole Incursion: A Squadron Chronicle

## Chapter 1: The Tear

Commander Dazbo adjusted the throttle of his trusty, if slightly battered, spaceship. The sensors were screaming—again. It wasn't the usual background radiation of the Void; it was the distinct, tearing sound of space-time being ripped open.

"They're coming through," Dazbo muttered, tapping the comms panel. "Squadron, report in. We have a confirmed Class-5 Wormhole Incursion event in Sector 7. Protocols are active."

One by one, the AI-piloted starships of his squadron chimed in. These weren't just dumb drones; they were fully sentient, highly specialized vessels, each with a personality as distinct—and frustrating—as their hull configurations.

"I'm detecting high-energy signatures," came the crisp, slightly anxious voice of **Relativistic Value**. "My sensors indicate a massive displacement. I'm ready to engage, but my shields are... nominal. Please don't let them hit my engines; the repair deductible is astronomical." The **Cobra Mk3** was a classic. It was fast, pushing **302 m/s**  but with only **38 Damage Per Second** (DPS), it wasn't a heavy hitter.

"Let 'em come," growled **Right Wing Politics**. The **Vulture** was a cheap brawler that punched above its weight. "I've got my hardpoints deployed and my diplomacy manifesto ready. Spoiler: it involves lasers." Even though it only had enough cargo space to store a moderately sized cheese sandwich, it was still a solid fighter with fast boosters, putting out **37 DPS**. "I'll stay close, Dazbo. Try not to miss."

"I am detecting distress beacons from the mining colony," interjected **Lost and Helpless**, the squadron's **Asp Explorer**. "I am better suited for search and rescue, Commander. I've got capacity for the refugees, and I can cover the perimeter. Also, I think I left my oven on."

"Agreed," Dazbo said. "Lost, get those people out. We'll hold the line."

## Chapter 2: The Void-Stalkers

A new signal flared on the radar. A large, jagged rift opened, and alien vessels poured out like hornets. These were the **Krellon Void-Stalkers**, a species known for their hive-mind tactics and hatred of non-purple colors.

"Target rich environment," noted **Xenophobic Tendencies**, the **Alliance Challenger**. "I have identified 42 targets. I can't wait to unload my **134 DPS** on our guests. I am engaging the lead vessel. I find their hull geometry offensive."

"Please try not to scratch the paint," sighed **Quietly Confident**, the sleek **Imperial Clipper**. "I just had a wax job at the orbital station. This finish is pearlescent."

"Style over substance," scoffed **Now We Do It My Way**. The **Fer-de-Lance** was a hunter-killer, armed with a huge railgun. "Watch and learn, shiny. I'm initiating the 'Alpha Strike' protocol."

The battle was chaotic. The alien ships used short-range wormhole jumps, known as "blink-drives," to flank, but Dazbo's AI wingmen adapted instantly.

"I'm taking heavy fire!" Dazbo yelled as his shields flickered. A Krellon drone had locked onto his exhaust manifold.

"Covering fire deployed," rumbled **Too Many Pies**. The **Anaconda** was a flying fortress, a massive **365 million credit** investment. It had a jump range of a staggering **31.4 LY**, which it usually used to find better bakeries. "I have **258 tons** of munitions and I am unloading on your pursuers. Also, I found a crate of jam tarts in the hold. Does anyone want one?"

"Focus, Pies!" Dazbo shouted.

## Chapter 3: The Leviathan

Suddenly, the alien mothership emerged: The **Star-Eater**. It was a leviathan of twisted metal, easily 3 kilometers long. It began charging its main weapon, the **Singularity Cannon**, aimed squarely at the planet behind them.

"It's too big for the squadron!" Dazbo shouted. "Sensors indicate its shield frequency is rotating every 0.4 seconds!"

"Not for me," said a calm, deep voice. **Attitude Adjuster**, the Federal **Corvette**, moved between the planet and the beam. The most expensive ship in the fleet at **658 million**. "Calculations complete. Targeting the thermal exhaust port. Goodbye, ugly."

The Corvette unleashed a torrent of dual C4 Huge Plasma Accelerators. The green balls of superheated death slammed into the mothership's emitter. The alien vessel shuddered, its Singularity Cannon backfiring and creating a localized black hole that swallowed the mothership whole.

The Krellon fleet, leaderless and confused, broke formation.

"They are retreating," stated **Relativistic Value**. "My probability matrix suggests a 99.8% chance of victory. The other 0.2% involves spontaneous engine failure. Oh dear."

## Chapter 4: The Aftermath

Silence returned to the sector. The debris of the Krellon fleet drifted harmlessly into the planet's gravity well, creating a lovely, if slightly toxic, meteor shower.

"Threat neutralized," Dazbo exhaled. "Sound off."

"Relativistic Value: Green. My insurance premiums are safe."
"Right Wing Politics: Hull at 80%. I think I offended their leader before he exploded. I'm not sorry."
"Lost and Helpless: Refugees secure. The oven was off, false alarm."
"Xenophobic Tendencies: Out of ammo. Requesting resupply and a firmly worded letter of complaint to the Krellon High Command."
"Quietly Confident: Paint scratched. Unacceptable. I demand a dock with a luxury spa."
"Now We Do It My Way: Scanning for stragglers. Found two escape pods. Shall I... intervene?"
"Too Many Pies: Reloading. Also, the jam tarts are gone. I ate them."
"Attitude Adjuster: Ready for next assignment. Cooling down main reactors."

Dazbo smiled, leaning back in his pilot's chair and checking his sensors one last time. "Good work, team. I'm putting the kettle on. Mine's an Earl Grey, hot. You guys... well, have some premium 10W-40."

"I prefer 'Cerulean Mist'," **Quietly Confident** chimed in.

"Don't push it," Dazbo laughed, engaging the Frame Shift Drive. "Let's go home. I need a pina colada."
